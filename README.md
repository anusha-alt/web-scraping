# Web Scraping and Summarization

This project extracts and summarizes content from web pages based on user queries, leveraging Python's web scraping and natural language processing capabilities. It uses **BeautifulSoup** for scraping, **Hugging Face Transformers** for summarization, and stores results in a **MongoDB Atlas** database. Users can input a query and URLs, and the system fetches relevant data, generates summaries, and saves them in an unstructured database.

## Features
- 📄 **Scrape and process content** from given URLs.
- 📝 **Summarize large text** using a pre-trained transformer model.
- 🗂️ **Store query results and summaries** in MongoDB Atlas for persistence.
- ⚡ **Easy-to-use Python script** compatible with Google Colab.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core scripting language.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Web scraping library.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face model for text summarization.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based unstructured database.
