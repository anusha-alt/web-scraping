# web-scraping

This project extracts and summarizes content from web pages based on user queries, leveraging Python's web scraping and natural language processing capabilities. It uses BeautifulSoup for scraping, Hugging Face Transformers for summarization, and stores results in a MongoDB Atlas database. Users can input a query and URLs, and the system fetches relevant data, generates summaries, and saves them in an unstructured database.

Features
Scrape and process content from given URLs.
Summarize large text using a pre-trained transformer model.
Store query results and summaries in MongoDB Atlas for persistence.
Easy-to-use Python script compatible with Google Colab.
